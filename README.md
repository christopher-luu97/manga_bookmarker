# Manga Tracking Application

## Introduction
Welcome to my Manga Tracking Application GitHub repository! This project is designed to streamline the process of tracking manga series. It solves the common challenge of managing a growing list of manga titles by providing a personalized platform for efficiently checking updates.

## Project Overview
The application is rooted in CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and features a user-friendly interface that displays data stored in a database. It's developed using a combination of technologies to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Frontend
- **Technologies Used**: React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript
- **Functionality**: The frontend provides an interactive interface for managing the manga list, including adding new links, updating records, and viewing the latest chapters.

### Backend
- **Technologies Used**: Python, FastAPI, Django (in-progress)
- **Functionality**: The backend handles API requests and data processing. `backend_scraper` uses FastAPI for efficient data handling and web scraping, while `backend_manga_tracker` is an in-progress module using Django.

### Database
- **Database Technology**: PostgreSQL
- **Role**: Stores and manages data related to manga series, including chapter URLs, thumbnails, and websites.

## Key Features
- Web scraping for manga data updates.
- CRUD operations for manga list management.
